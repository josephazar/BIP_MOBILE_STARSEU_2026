Run flutter pub get in the AuthCraftFlutter directory. Here's how:
cd "/Users/josephazar/Desktop/Android/BIP/BIP-Mobile Technologies and Programming/AuthCraftFlutter"
flutter pub get
Or since you're currently in that directory already (based on the file you opened), you can just run:
flutter pub get
This command will:
Read the pubspec.yaml file
Download all dependencies:
flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0
http: ^1.1.0
provider: ^6.1.1
Generate the necessary lock files
After running flutter pub get, you can then run the app with:

flutter create --platforms=android .

flutter run
Note: Make sure you have the backend server running first:
cd "../user-auth-backend"
npm start
